Reverse Number Program in C#


This C# console application reverses the digits of a number entered by the user.
For example, if the user inputs 1234, the program outputs 4321.

How It Works

The program asks the user to enter a number.

It reads the input and converts it into an integer.

It reverses the number using a for loop:

The last digit is added to the reversed number.

The last digit is removed from the original number.

The reversed number is displayed on the console.
